Major Steps involved : 

1) ER diagram was created after brainstorming several insights and requirements. shorturl.at/bdlG5
2) Identify different sources to consolidate the data( usnews.com, economist.com, bloomberg.com, topuniversities.com)
3) Find ways to **Extract** the data in to the csv file , **Transform** the data and **Load**(DDL) the data into MS SQL Server.
4) Perform DML operations to answer business transactions
5) Visualize the insights using Tableau Dashboards for the presentation
6) Provide overall insights and suggestions particularly to Robert H. Smith school of Business - University of Maryland - College Park .

Inferences : 
1) Class Size is negatively correlated with the Rankings , as the class size reduces, the rank of the B-School improves.
2) The higher number of networking events a B-School conducts , the higher the rank the school has.
3) Percentage of Faculty with PhD plays a pivotal role in the ranking of a B- School.
4) The more the geographical diversity a classroom has, the higher the rank the school has.
5) Students ratings of program content is very much in line with the school rankings
6) The availability of Facilities in a B-School is not a significant factor or not correlated with the rank of B- Schools
7) Employer Reputation Influences Ranking Significantly along with Average GRE, Average GMAT and Average GPA scores.
8) Higher the average Tuition fees of a B-school, higher the average Offered income to the students.
9) Universities having students with a larger average work experience have better rankings.
10) States- MA, Illinois, California have 2 top-10 universities each.
11) The top 10 schools have an application fee greater than $200 and yet see a 3 times higher number of applicants.

Suggestions to the Robert H.Smith School : 
1) Reduce the class size
2) Conduct more networking events
3) Employ more faculties who hold a PhD degree
4) Increase the geographical diversity score in the classroom
5) Improve their program curriculum
6) Increase the admission scores’ requirements
